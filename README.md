## ✨ Highlights & Key Features

### 🎙️ Misa Live Voice & Multimodal AI
- **Real-Time Bidirectional Voice**: Ultra-low-latency conversational AI with native Audio Worklet streaming.
- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD) & Interruptions**: Speak naturally; Misa pauses and listens the moment you talk.
- **Dynamic Audio Routing**: Seamless switching between device earpiece, speakerphone, wired headphones, and Bluetooth earbuds (`RECORD_AUDIO`, `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`).
- **Camera & Vision Understanding**: Snap photos of textbook problems or handwritten equations for instant step-by-step guidance.
- **Leak-Free Stream Sanitizer**: Built-in control-token scrubber strips BOS/EOS tokens (`<|begin_of_sentence|>`, `<|im_start|>`, etc.) in real time.

### 📋 Custom To-Dos & Modern Arrange Mode
- **Dual Study Tracks**: Switch effortlessly between the structured **90-Day Curriculum** and the **Flexible Daily To-Do Track**.
- **Intuitive Gestures**: Slide right to delete, slide left to edit, and tap to mark tasks as completed.
- **Modern Arrange Mode**: Reorder your daily priorities with smooth drag-and-drop or one-tap chevron buttons (`↑` / `↓`).
- **Granular Tagging**: Priority pills (High, Med, Low), estimated durations (15m to 90m), and subject filters (Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Revision, General).
- **Safety Confirmations**: Uncompleting a finished task prompts an instant confirmation dialog to prevent accidental clicks.

### 🤖 Autonomous AI Tools & Plan Manager
- **Function Calling**: Misa can create, edit, reschedule, and delete tasks directly on your device.
- **Safety-First Flow**: Destructive actions (like bulk deletions or schedule overwrites) require explicit confirmation before execution.
- **Transparent Status Badges**: Tool execution states show exact details (`✅ Success`, `⏳ Approval Needed`, `❌ Failed`).

### 📦 In-App Modular APK Updates
- **Automatic Version Detection**: Checks GitHub Releases for signed APKs with semantic/date tag comparisons.
- **Download & Install (1-Click)**: Streams APK in chunks with live byte-level progress and immediately opens the system package installer.
- **Download Only Mode**: Downloads and caches the APK without forcing an instant installer popup.
- **Storage Transparency & Share**: Displays the exact file location (`updates/levelup.apk`) with options to install, share to Google Drive/Downloads/WhatsApp via native share sheet, or delete cached files.
- **Android 8.0 to Android 15+ Compatibility**: Fully configured with `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` and FileProvider content URIs.

### 🎯 90-Day Habit Engine & Exam Month Protocol
- **30 Levels Across 4 Phases**: Systematic habit progression covering deep work, morning routines, error logging, and revision cycles.
- **Mastery Placement**: Automatically groups mastered tasks into permanent completed vaults while allowing flexible re-scheduling.
- **Recovery Mode**: Automatically activates if daily completion drops below 30% to rebuild momentum with essential core tasks.
- **Exam Month Mode**: Auto-triggers 30 days before your JEE Main attempt date, switching the daily focus to revision and mock test analysis.

### 🌐 Multi-Provider Architecture
- **Google Gemini API**: Direct support for Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and multimodal live sessions.
- **SmartRotator & OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints**: Custom proxy and fallback support with auto-rotating keys and resilient retry loops.
